# Braindotnet
Developed during [Edison Pebojot](https://www.github.com/workpebojot/)'s freshman year at [AMA Computer University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMA_Computer_University), Braindotnet is a PWA social networking application. It was specifically created in the year 2018. The old website is still up and running, and you can find it [here](https://braindotnet.web.app/). If you are on a desktop, press **F12**

## Motivation

The goal is to create a tool for students to communicate with one another. I originally intended it to be a quiz app for students, but it evolved into a social networking app.

## Technology and Framework used

- Firebase
- Onsen UI
- JavaScript
- Node

## Code Example

The content will be initialized at the BODY id:
```html
index.hmtl > #BODY
```

## Installation

1. `$ git clone [URL.git]`
2. `$ cd braindotnet`
3. `$ git init`
4. `$ npm install`

## How to used
As you may know, I was a freshman in college at the time and am now a graduate student. I had completely forgotten how this project works. What I recall is that you'll need a firebase CLI and that you'll use `firebase init` to create a new project. That's all there is to it; now you can code whatever you want. Then, using `firebase deploy`, you can upload your production folder to firebase hosting.
