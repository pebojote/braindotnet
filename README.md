## How to used
As we all know, I was a freshman college student and now I am a graduate student. I completely forgot how this freaking project works. What I still remember is you need a firebase CLI and initialize a new project using `firebase init`. That's it, now you can code what you want. After that, you use `firebase deploy` to deploy your production to firebase hosting.
